# DeepRL
In this repository, I create and store the code that I write while I learn some ***Deep*** *Reinforcement Learning* algorithms.

Please keep in mind that while implementing the Deep RL algorithms
that I learn, I try to use as **little** library function as possible,
in order to get down and dirty with the **math** of it.

However, in order to avoid wasting hours to create a convolutional neural network
(only to realize afterwards that it performs horribly), I use *PyTorch* for
all my neural network needs.

As for the environments, I chose to use *Gym* by OpenAI, again in order to
avoid recreating old Atari games myself. That would be some good programming workout, however, I
chose to focus on deep learning and RL for the time being.

####Works in progress:
- **Deep Q Learning**: Currently working to implement DQN on BreakOut environment.
